You can run this python script with whatever class you would like
python downloader.py ml
python downloader.py ai
python downloader.py db

Once that command has finished running (it will take a while), you will have a ml/db/ai directory filled with every lecture currently published. You can run the command again in the future and it will only download the newly added lectures. 

Please fork and make better or fix. Pull requests welcome :)
