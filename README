The only dependency is the python requests library 
http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html

Installation is as easy as 
pip install requests

After that, you can run the python script with whichever class
python downloader.py ml
python downloader.py db
python downloader.py ai

Once that command has finished running (it will take a while), you will have a ml/db/ai directory filled with every lecture currently published. You can run the command again in the future and it will only download the newly added lectures. 

Please fork and make better or fix. Pull requests welcome :)
